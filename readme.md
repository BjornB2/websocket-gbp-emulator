# Websocket GBP Emulator

A GameBoy printer emulator which provides the received data over a websocket.
This code has been created for a "LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 R2 & mini" [ESP2866 based board](https://github.com/esp8266/arduino).   
For uploading the Filesystem the LittleFS tool [Arduino IDE Plugin](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-esp8266littlefs-plugin/releases) is required

## ToDo's
* ~~[mDNS](https://tttapa.github.io/ESP8266/Chap08%20-%20mDNS.html)~~
* ~~Webserver serving a static Web-Application (will be in a [different Repository](https://github.com/HerrZatacke/gb-printer-web))~~


## Done
* ~~Websockets serving received printer packages~~
* Websocket implementation has been removed due to performance issues, instead the ESP should now detect the presence of the GameBoy over it's 5V signal. and Either Boot in "server" or "printer" mode  

## Demo Video
âš  Obviusly you should not power the ESP from the GameBoy, as this might damage the GameBoy itself.
